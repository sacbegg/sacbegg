### Hi there 👋

# Sacbe García
## MSc in Statistical Computation

I am an applied mathematician and statistical computer scientist, with a focus on data science, where I have acquired skills in data analysis, machine learning and natural language processing. 👇

My interest lies at the intersection of technology and social issues, especially in the protection of human rights. I strongly believe in the power of data and technology to address social challenges and contribute to positive change in our society.

With a background in finance and research at the Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT), I have developed skills in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis and data visualization. In addition, I have experience in the application of NLP techniques to address problems in various contexts.

I am a proactive person, passionate about continuous learning and complex problem solving. I consider myself a committed collaborator and enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams to find innovative solutions.

I am always looking for opportunities to apply my data science and NLP skills in projects that have a positive impact on society and contribute to the protection of human rights.

Feel free to contact me to explore possible collaborations or chat about exciting projects! 😁

My key competencies include:

- Machine learning models
- Deep learning models
- Natural Language models
- Data processing
- Data analysis
- Python programming
